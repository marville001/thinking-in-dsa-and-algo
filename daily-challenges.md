Given an array of strings, return the longest common prefix that is shared amongst all strings.
Note: you may assume all strings only contain lowercase alphabetical characters.


Ex: Given the following arrays...

	["colorado", "color", "cold"], return "col"
	["a", "b", "c"], return ""
	["spot", "spotty", "spotted"], return "spot"

2.	This question is asked by Apple. 

Given two binary strings (strings containing only 1s and 0s) return their sum (also as a binary string).
Note: neither binary string will contain leading 0s unless the string itself is 0

Ex: Given the following binary strings...

	"100" + "1", return "101"
	"11" + "1", return "100"
	"1" + "0", return  "1"
