1.	This question is asked by Microsoft.

Given an array of strings, return the longest common prefix that is shared amongst all strings.
Note: you may assume all strings only contain lowercase alphabetical characters.


Ex: Given the following arrays...

	["colorado", "color", "cold"], return "col"
	["a", "b", "c"], return ""
	["spot", "spotty", "spotted"], return "spot"

2.	This question is asked by Apple. 

Given two binary strings (strings containing only 1s and 0s) return their sum (also as a binary string).
Note: neither binary string will contain leading 0s unless the string itself is 0

Ex: Given the following binary strings...

	"100" + "1", return "101"
	"11" + "1", return "100"
	"1" + "0", return  "1"

 palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards. Given a string, s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.


 Example:

	Output: "anana"

	Input: "million"
	Output: "illi"

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

Example

	arr = [1,3,4,7,9];
	returns 16 24

The minimum sum is 16 and the maximum sum is 24. The function prints

	16 24

Given a time in -hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

Example

	s = '12:01:00PM
	Return '12:01:00'.

	s = '12:01:00AM'
	Return '00:01:00'.
